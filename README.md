5. Now head over to our [issue board](https://github.com/DevDHera/COVID-19-Chrome-Extension/issues) and help solving issues üëº.

### Prerequisites

`COVID-19-Chrome-Extension` uses **[Angular](https://angular.io/)** to manage codebase.

In order to successfully run the project install the following.

- Node.js

### Configurations

After setting up the above you can add multiple sources to get the stats using `environment` files.

Following is the structure that we are using.

```ts
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  apiUrl: 'YOUR_API_URL',
  csvUrl: 'YOUR_CSV_DATA_URL',
};
```

## Deployment

To do a production build of your extension first you need to update the version number inside `./angular/src/manifest.json`.

```json
{
  "manifest_version": 2,
  "name": "COVID 19 - Stats (SL)",
  "short_name": "COVID 19 - Stats (SL)",
  "version": "YOUR_VERSION_NUMBER",
  "description": "Get latest situation reports of COVID-19 in Sri Lanka",
  "permissions": ["activeTab"],
  "browser_action": {
    "default_popup": "index.html?#/popup",
    "default_title": "Angular Chrome Extension"
  },
  "content_scripts": [
    {
      "js": ["contentPage.js"],
      "matches": ["<all_urls>"]
    }
  ],
  "background": {
    "scripts": ["backgroundPage.js"],
    "persistent": false
  },
  "content_security_policy": "script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval'; object-src 'self'",
  "icons": {
    "16": "assets/img/logo/logo-16x16.png",
    "32": "assets/img/logo/logo-24x24.png",
    "48": "assets/img/logo/logo-32x32.png",
    "128": "assets/img/logo/logo-128x128.png"
  }
}
```

Now simply run the below command build and zip the extension.

```sh
npm run build:production
```

After running the above you will get `extension-build.zip` in the root folder. You can upload it to the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/developer/dashboard).
